Great progress! Let me check your remaining tasks...

You still have 1 open task:

Once you complete T-010, you'll be all set for vacation!

Would you like me to help you finish T-010 or reassign it to someone else?
```

## Implementation Details

The vacation logic is implemented in:

1. **CSV Task Node** (`csv_task_node.py`) - System message with vacation approval logic
2. **Return Prompt** (`return_prompt.py`) - Updated prompts for "Agentic AI" and "CSV Tasks" usecases

The system will:

1. Check task status using CSV tools
2. Identify open tasks (In Progress or Pending)
3. Deny vacation if open tasks exist
4. Approve vacation if all tasks are completed
5. Provide specific task details and next steps
